# CalculusOfInductiveTypes

Based heavily on the [Haskell Morte Library](https://github.com/Gabriella439/Haskell-Morte-Library/blob/main/src/Morte/Core.hs), a small toy language that implements the Calculus of Constructions with Inductive Types, with the goal of turning it into a full-fledged proof assistant. The current functionality is just a tokenizer and parser, this will change soon!

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:calculus_of_inductive_types, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
